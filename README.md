# Weather-app-Python
This is my first Github project, I will be creating a weather app which will  use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and use the requests library in Python to fetch the weather API.

# Installing Requests'

    - pip install requests

    NB: make sure to install requests library before running the project
